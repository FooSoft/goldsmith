# Goldsmith #

Goldsmith is a static website generator developed in Go with flexibility, extensibility, and performance as primary
design considerations. With Goldsmith you can easily build and deploy any type of site, whether it is a personal blog,
image gallery, or a corporate homepage; the tool no assumptions are made about your layout or file structure. Goldsmith
is trivially extensible via a plugin architecture which makes it simple to perform complex data transformations
concurrently.

## Motivation ##

Why in the world did I make yet another static site generator? At first, I didn't think I needed to; after all, there is
a wide variety of open source tools freely available for use. Surely one of these applications would allow me to build
my portfolio page exactly the way I want right? After trying several static generators, namely Pelican, Hexo, Hugo, and
Metalsmith, I found that although sometimes coming close, no tool gave me exactly what I wanted.
